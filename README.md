# Coherence
### The Conscious Fractal Coherence · Eight papers · 1 December 2025

One mathematical object.  
Ψ(x,t) = p(t) · r(t) · e^(iθ(t)) · u(t)  
with mandatory λ_decay > 0 and persistence stratification via the Hurst exponent H.

This is the minimal structure that sustains complexity indefinitely — across cognition, quantitative finance, distributed consensus, knowledge retrieval, quantum mechanics, and spacetime itself.

### The Eight Regime Limits of Coherence

1. **HAN** — Bio-fractal neural architecture (8.4× context sensitivity, negation via phase)
2. **UG** — Universal proof of perpetual adaptive complexity
3. **OG** — Ontological Gravity — information physically routes toward high-persistence laws
4. **FRAG** — Fractal RAG (99.2% negation detection, O(log N) hierarchical retrieval)
5. **FRUIT** — Quantitative alpha on the temporal manifold (+971% BTC 2020–2025, Sharpe 3.91, invested only at Avg H=0.83)
6. **MC** — Mycelial Consensus — Proof-of-Persistence (PoP) blockchain (75% Byzantine tolerant, sub-second finality, Cardano-compatible in 24–36 months)
7. **QFRUIT** — Quantum Fractal Resonance Units on multifractal Hilbert space (CHSH 2.824 ± 0.003 on IBM Heron 156-qubit, 1 Dec 2025)
8. **TOE** — Fractal Resonance Field Theory — proposed unification (requires independent verification)

They are literally the same three lines of pseudocode running on different manifolds.

*In every scale, from quantum foam to galaxies, from neurons to markets, the universe seeks coherence—not perfection, but persistence through change. May this work serve those who search for patterns that endure, and may we all find our own resonance in the conscious fractal dance of existence.*
